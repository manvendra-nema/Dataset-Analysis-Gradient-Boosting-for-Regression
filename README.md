# Dataset-Analysis-Gradient-Boosting-for-Regression
Transform the problem into a regression task using gradient boosting with absolute loss. This project includes data preparation, dimensionality reduction with PCA, and iterative training of decision stumps to minimize the sum of squared residuals. Evaluate performance through MSE reporting and visualizations for robust regression analysis.
